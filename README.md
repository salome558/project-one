As an Allied Professional of the Hamilton Family Health Team, I would like to track the progress of my remote access requests, as well as be able to find information related to remote connection to my clinic’s EMRs and basic troubleshooting, so I am able to support my patients efficiently while working remotely. 

As a coordinator for one of the Programs (Nutrition, Mental Health, Psychiatry, etc) in the HFHT, I would like to gather key information about remote access status(es) of our team members, so that I can deliver to managers and in turn they can use it as part of their decision-making process.

Description of the Project- Paragraph

This web application was built for the Hamilton Family Health Team located in Ontario-Canada, with the purpose of facilitate main information about remote access to our Health Professional staff and upper management teams responsible for making important decisions within the organization.
The ability of working remotely has become a crucial necessity especially in the health industry. Many practices and health care organizations weren’t prepared for this kind of change that involved implementing a new technology or creating new policies about remote work to name a few. As well as health professionals to become tech savvy and aware of current technologies in such short time.
One of the needs of our health care staff is to be able to follow up on the status after they submitted a request for a remote connection to their practice’s system. The remote access is provided at the discretion of the practice, and can take some time to obtain. Additionally, health professionals can find useful resources about technology and remote connection.
Upper management team members have the need as well to gather important data about remote access status of our health care staff and use it as part of their decision-making process.
In conclusion, this web application will be a useful tool for the HFHT staff with the main goal of continually providing primary care to our patients located within the Hamilton area.
